```{r setup}

```

## The `keyring` package

The [keyring](https://github.com/gaborcsardi/keyring) package enables us to secure any credential by leveraging the operating system's credential store. We will use this capability to securely store database credentials.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("gaborcsardi/keyring")
```

## Keyrings and keys

Inside the credential store there are `keyrings` that contain multiple `keys`.  A `keyring` is secured with a single password, which then grants acccess to to all of its `keys`.  In our case, we will store a single database connection credential per `key`. We will use the default keyring, which is automatically un-locked when a user signs in.

## Our first key

A `key` has four main attributes:

- `service` - This is the key's unique identifier, we will use the database server's path for our keys.
- `keyring` - The key's 'parent' keyring. If not specified, the default keyring is used.
- `username`
- `password` 

The way `keyring` retrieves data is by passing the `keyring` name and a `service` name. If no `keyring` is passed, the default keyring is used.

We only create the key one time:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
keyring::key_set_with_value(service = "mssql-database", 
                            username = "newuser", 
                            password = "abc123")
```

## Retrieve credentials

The `key_list()` command is used to retrieve the `username`:

```{r}
keyring::key_list("mssql-database")
```

To extract the only the `username`, so as to pass it inside the connection string, use:

```{r}
keyring::key_list("mssql-database")[1,2]
```

To extract the `password`, use `key_get()`:

```{r}
keyring::key_get("mssql-database")
```

These functions can be used to supply the database credentials without storing them in plain text or an environment variable:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), 
  "SQLServer", # A driver defined in odbcinst.ini
  Server="mssql-database",
  Port=1433,
  Database="default",
  UID= keyring::key_list("mssql-database")[1,2],
  PWD= keyring::key_get("mssql-database"))
```

The default keyring is unlocked anytime the user is signed in. If a new keyring is created and used, the Operating System will prompt the user for the `keyring` password when the code executes.
