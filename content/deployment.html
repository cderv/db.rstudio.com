<p>Deploying and sharing content with database connections requires special care. There are two primary considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Matching drivers beteen development and deployment environment</li>
<li>Managing credentials between development and deployment environments</li>
</ul>
<p>Luckily, the <code>config</code> package and the <code>keyring</code> package make it easy to address these concerns.</p>
